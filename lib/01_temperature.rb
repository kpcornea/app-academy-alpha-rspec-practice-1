# # Remember that one degree fahrenheit is 5/9 of one degree celsius,
# # and that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees celsius but 32
# # degrees fahrenheit.
# #
# # In integer math, there **are no fractions**. So if you are using
# # integer literals, you will be using integer math, which means, for
# # example...
# #
# #    1 / 2 => 0
# #
# # In floating point math, there **are** fractions. So...
# #
# #    1.0 / 2.0 => 0.5
#
# require "01_temperature"
